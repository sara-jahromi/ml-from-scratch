# ML From Scratch

This repository contains small machine learning implementations written from scratch in Python for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Scope
- Core ML algorithms implemented without high-level ML libraries
- Focus on understanding fundamentals rather than performance

## Status
Work in progress. Initial implementation coming next.
